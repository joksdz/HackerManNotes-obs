## ISP Services 

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are the ones who connect the home network or office... etc  to the internet , An ISP can be the local cable provider , a landline telephone service provider , a cellular network provider for smartphones  or an independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company . 
Many ISPs offer some addon services such as : network storage , security features , web hosting...etc 
ISPs are the bones of the internet since they are the one connecting the user with other users across the sea , they do so by connecting each other via physical wires which connect cities , countries and continents using fiber-optic wires that are buried underground or under the ocean , ISPs make sure that the internet traffic generally takes the shortest path from source to destination .

## ISP Connections 
the interconnection between ISPs forms the backbone of the internet and its a really complex web of fiber-optic cables  with expensive switches and routers that direct the flow of information between the source and destination hosts 
The simplest form of an ISP connection its basically a computer (or a device ) connected to a modem directly that connects to the ISP line , although its simple this model is  insecure and should never be used this way 
the most common connection is consisted of a computer (or device or multiple ) connected to a router and then to a modem which connects the router to the internet , the router usually have wireless capabilities to help connect different devices , it also provides IP info and has security capabilities to help protect the users  

## Cable and DSL Connections 
Most home network don't use fiber-optics to connect to the internet and the most common methods are : 
- cable : typically offered by cable television service provider the internet is carried on the same coaxial cable that delivers cable television , it provides high bandwidth always on internet connection a special cable modem  separates the internet data signal from the other signals and provides an Ethernet connection to the computer or LAN 
- DSL : Digital subscriber line provides a high bandwidth always on connection to the internet , it requires a special high-speed modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal and provides Ethernet connection to the LAN , DSL runs over the telephone line and it splits into three channels , the first one is used for voice telephone calls so that you can receive phone calls without disconnecting from the internet , the second one is used for fast downloading and receiving info from the internet , the last channel is used for uploading and its usually slower than the second channel ,the quality and speed is dependent on the quality of the cables from the isp and the distance between the LAN and the ISP

there are other connectivity options such as cellular internet access uses the cell phone network to connect wherever you can get the cellular signal the performance is limited by the capabilities of the phone and the signal of the cell tower its down sides are : meted bandwidth by the cell provider and high cost 
satellite : satellite service is a good option for homes or offices that do not have access to DSL or cable , satellite dishes require a clear line of sight and so might be difficult in places with tons of obstructions speeds will vary depending on the contract though they are generally good , cost of equipment can be high , with moderate monthly fees  .
