## Network infrastructure 
the path that a message takes from its source to destination can be as simple as just a single wire connecting two  devices , or as complex as a network that literally spans the globe , this network infrastructure is the platform that supports the network , it provides the stable and reliable channel over which out communications can occur .
the network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware components : 
- end devices 
- intermediate devices 
- network media

devices and media are the physical elements or hardware of the network , hardware is often visible such as a computer , phone , switch , router , wire but it can be invisible to the naked eye such as when transmitting data using WAP through the antenna with invisible radio frequencies or infrared waves . 
## End devices 
the network devices that are the most known are called end devices , these devices form the interface between users and the underlying communication network 
some ex : 
- computers ( workstations , laptops , file server , web server )
- network printers 
- telephones 
- security cameras 
- mobile devices ( smart phones , tablets , PDAs , and wireless debit card readers and barcode scanners)
an end device is either the source or the destination of the data transmition ,  in order to uniquely identify hosts , addresses are used 
when a host initiates communication  it uses the addresses of the destination host to specify where the message should be sent  .
## intermediate devices 
these devices control the flow of the messages in the network so that the message get for the sender to a specific receiver , they can be used for securing the network (firewalls)
## Network media 
these represent the way that messages transfer in the network , either with wired connection that uses electrical pulses or with light (fiber-optics ), as well as through the air using special radio frequencies  or infrared waves .
