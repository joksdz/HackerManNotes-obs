## Client and Server Roles
Every device that is connected to the network is considered to be a host , hosts can send and receive data , in modern networking hosts can be clients , servers or both and that's determined by the software that its running 

client --> internet --> server 

Servers are hosts that have specific software on them that enables them to provide info , like email services or web pages , each of these services require a separate server software 
Clients are Computer hosts that have specific software on them that enables them to receive info obtained from the server like a web browser , or and email client software .

## Peer-To-Peer networks(P2P)
Client and server software usually run on separate computers , but its possible to have both the client and server exchanging roles and thus being able send and receive info , in small businesses or SOHO(small office home office ) networks many computes run on a P2P network .

The simples ``P2P`` network is 2 computers connected directly to each other via ethernet or fiber or wireless transmission both devices are then able to exchange info acting as both the sender and receiver ( client and server) .

Multiple devices can be connected as well but that would require a switch 
the main disadvantage of P2P networks is its effect on performance since the hosts are acting as both the server and the client at the same time as well as some other disadvantages such as : 
- NO centralized administration 
- Not as secure 
- Scalability issues 
- Slower performance 
the main advantages of P2P : 
- easy to setup 
- low cost 
- less complex 
thus making it very good when used with simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers 
## P2P Applications 
A P2P app allows devices to act as both the server and the client , Some P2P apps use hybrid systems where resource sharing is decentralized , but the indexes that point to the resource location are stored  in a centralized directory , in hybrid systems each peer accesses and index server  to get the location of a resource stored on another peer .

## Multiple Roles in the Network 
A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to one or many clients 
Additionally , a single computer can run multiple types of server software , in a SOHO network , it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server , a web server and email server 
A single computer can also run multiple types of client software , there must be client software for every service required b, with multiple clients installed , a host can connect to  multiple servers at the same time , ex : a user can read emails while on a  web page and listening to a podcast
